      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>
        My research is in macroeconomics, with a focus on monetary and fiscal policy, inequality, heterogeneous-agent models, and quantitative macroeconomics.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Job Market Paper</strong><br>
        <em>Unfunded Fiscal Policy with Heterogeneity in Household Portfolios</em>.  
        I study the macroeconomic and distributional consequences of unfunded fiscal policy in a heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian model with incomplete markets, endogenous portfolio choice, and long-term nominal debt. Unfunded expansions—policies not fully backed by higher expected future primary surpluses—operate through price-level revaluation and portfolio rebalancing: inflation erodes the real value of outstanding nominal liabilities, shifts wealth from nominal creditors toward net debtors, and raises spending by high-MPC households. In the calibrated economy, unfunded government purchases and unfunded transfers generate very similar impulse responses and deliver materially larger multipliers than funded policies, while compressing consumption inequality by raising bottom and middle consumption shares.

        <strong>Working Papers</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Taylor Rules and Fiscal Attention to Inflation</em>.  
        I analyze equilibrium determinacy in a New Keynesian model where the primary surplus rule responds to both inflation and government debt, and the surplus enters the Euler equation so that fiscal policy directly shifts the intertemporal IS curve. When fiscal policy targets inflation but not debt, I derive an analytical condition linking the monetary and fiscal inflation responses and show that determinacy can be achieved even with a Taylor coefficient below one, provided fiscal policy reacts strongly enough to inflation. When fiscal policy also stabilizes debt, numerical methods show that part of the fiscal inflation response is absorbed by debt stabilization, so monetary policy must react more than one-for-one to inflation, with the required Taylor coefficient rising in the degree of fiscal attention to inflation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Identifying the Effects of Funded vs. Unfunded Fiscal Shocks</em> (with Nathan S. Balke and Carlos Zarazaga).  
        We estimate a structural VAR for U.S. annual data using a combination of zero and sign restrictions on the present value of primary surpluses and the market value of government debt to disentangle funded deficit shocks—those that leave the present value of current and future primary surpluses unchanged—from unfunded shocks resolved through price-level adjustment. The identification delivers impulse responses and historical decompositions showing that funded deficit shocks are approximately Ricardian and have little effect on economic activity, whereas unfunded deficit shocks raise inflation and real GDP growth, lower nominal returns on government debt on impact, and account for a moderate share of post-1960 inflation fluctuations.

      <h3>Teaching</h3>
      <p>
        I see teaching as an opportunity to make macroeconomics accessible and meaningful for students with diverse backgrounds. In the classroom, I emphasize clear economic intuition, step-by-step derivations, and a supportive environment where every student can keep up and ask questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        As lead instructor for <strong>ECON 3302: Intermediate Macroeconomics</strong> (Summer II 2024, SMU), I revisited core mathematical tools such as derivatives to build a common foundation, wrote out derivations in detail using a tablet projected in class, and shared slides and typed lecture notes after each meeting. I held extended office hours beyond the standard requirement and used current policy and real-world examples—such as recent Federal Reserve decisions or investment in new technologies—to connect abstract models to students’ everyday experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a teaching assistant at Southern Methodist University and the University of Wisconsin–Madison, I have supported a wide range of courses, including intermediate macroeconomics, applied econometrics, principles of macroeconomics (honors), micro theory, predictive analytics, forecasting, state and local government, and advanced intermediate macroeconomic theory. These roles have involved leading recitations, grading, holding review sessions, and mentoring students one-on-one on problem sets, empirical projects, and research ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        My teaching interests include macroeconomics (principles, intermediate, money and banking), quantitative economics and forecasting, econometrics and predictive analytics, international macroeconomics, and inequality and public policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was honored to receive the <strong>Outstanding Graduate Student Instruction Award</strong> at Southern Methodist University in 2025, a university-wide teaching award recognizing three graduate instructors per year. I strive to create an inclusive classroom in which students feel seen and encouraged—so that even if they forget some formulas years later, they remember economics as rigorous, relevant, and worth engaging with.
